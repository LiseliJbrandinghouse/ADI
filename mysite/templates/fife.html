    <h2>A Fife for Freedom</h2>

      Our lessons of over 60 years since the first state was planted in Africa,
      and since the fall of the apartheid regime in South Africa in 1994, all
      demand for new action in Africa. This includes eugenics against
      Africans—the dreaded decades of HIV/AIDS, profound experiences of
      COVID‑19, the genetically modified foods, and a compromised pharmaceutical
      industry. Others are the devastating wars in Africa and elsewhere,
      including the growing instability in the Sahel region and wide-spread
      effects of climate change. The growing racism especially on our African
      brothers and sisters beyond the shores of Africa have taken their own toll
      on us. All these indicate that AFRICA is now at a tipping point wherein
      she begs for urgent and extra‑ordinary measures from every African in the
      world.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the possibility of the Third World War teeters before our eyes, global
      forces continue to operate Africa under their own tethers of a mafia law.
      And so, until Africa operates as one, the future for all Africans is cast
      in serious jeopardy.

      Pan‑Afrikanism has a long history of the anti‑slavery, anti‑racial,
      anti‑colonialism, and anti‑apartheid periods. Part of that history
      includes the First All‑African Conference held in Accra (1958), the second
      in Tunis (1960), and the third in Cairo (1961). These conferences yielded
      remarkable results for our civil liberties and political freedoms, and yet
      we still grapple with neo‑colonialism and social injustice with the need
      to re‑master our destiny anew, thus the Afrika Declaration Indaba.
    </p>
    <p>
      This and much more justifies why Africa, now and more than ever, needs a
      united State of Africa—yes, the panacea of everything savvy to redress our
      predicament and chart a new path forward.

  <h2 class="clarion-heading">Our Clarion Call to Filial Duty</h2>
  <div class="clarion-content">
    <p>
      Africa sits at the threshold of global changes of the need for stability.
      But, Africa’s own myriad of problems demand for a new incus to thought
      process. Clearly, the time to move from philosophizing to action has now
      come. This demands a people’s pristine voice of democratic value and
      expression. For this reason, the African masses are summoned to the
      exercise of their right to self‑determination as a democratic means
      through which a State of Africa can now be proclaimed. There is also a
      need for tackling issues of immediate goals for socio‑economic inclusion
      and outright emancipation of all the peoples of Africa. At this
      conference, therefore, a perfect moment has arisen for the people to make
      a historic proclamation of one State of Africa—in Africa’s very natural
      ethos to unity in diversity based on our rich cultural heritage. That way
      we will be dealing with the cause and not symptoms of Africa’s predicament
      within opposing global forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Without a stable, strong, and prosperous Africa, at peace with herself,
      while firmly anchored on her own democratic value system, the African
      people cannot hold hope for dignity in the spaces of competing global
      ideological poles. The fate, therefore, of one African in one corner of
      the world is well intertwined with the fate of every African at home; thus
      the need to act together. The Africa of our dreams is one that is
      illuminated by safety, inclusion, and the pursuit of joy and happiness for
      all of her peoples—yes, wherein it is envisaged of us to witness a speedy
      vestige of bad governance fading away in the mirage of the past.
